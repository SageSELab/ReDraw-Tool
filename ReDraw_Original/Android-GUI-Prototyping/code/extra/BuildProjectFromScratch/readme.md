This was my attempt at building a project from scratch using some input files and gradle. It probably won't work on your computer for several reasons:

 * The directory of the Android SDK is hard-coded into build.gradle
 * You need to generate a debug keystore via Android Studio; I'm figuring
   out how to get around this

Anyway, try it out and see if you can get it to run.
